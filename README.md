# HW2
Homework 2 - Procedural Python
### Assignment
1. Create a new Jupyter notebook called 'SEDS-HW2.ipynb' and finish the in class excersize of creating a block of code to download the pronto data, unzip it and load it into a data frame in Python (not using %% bash magic!) so that it works for a single file.
2. Run the code you put together for the three files below.  Use Markdown between the set of cells to offset and explain your work.

| URL | filename | csv_filename |
|-----|----------|--------------|
| https://github.com/UWSEDS/LectureNotes/blob/master/open_data_year_two_set1.zip?raw=true | open_data_year_two_set1.zip | 2016_trip_data_set1.csv |
| https://github.com/UWSEDS/LectureNotes/blob/master/open_data_year_two_set2.zip?raw=true | open_data_year_two_set2.zip | 2016_trip_data_set2.csv |
| https://github.com/UWSEDS/LectureNotes/blob/master/open_data_year_two_set3.zip?raw=true | open_data_year_two_set3.zip | 2016_trip_data_set3.csv |

3. In a separate set of cells, use lists, tuples, dictionaries, for loops, if statements, and whatever other tasty Python bits you want to run your code on the three files so that you don't replicate code.
4. Use the Markdown in the notebook to describe how using these features of Python made your code shorter, more easy to read, and easier to maintain.
5. Pick one of the data transformations you used in homework 1 (or that you find interesting) and add it to your code in #3 above.
